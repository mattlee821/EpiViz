\arguments{
\item{track_number}{The number of tracks you wnat your circos plot to have. Maximum number of tracks is 3.}

\item{track1_data}{The data frame of your first track.}

\item{track2_data}{The data frame of your second track.}

\item{track3_data}{The data frame of your third track.}

\item{track1_type}{The type of plot for the first track. One of "scatter", "lines", "bar" and "histogram".}

\item{track2_type}{The type of plot for the second track. One of "scatter", "lines", "bar" and "histogram".}

\item{track3_type}{The type of plot for the third track. One of "scatter", "lines", "bar" and "histogram".}

\item{label_column}{The column in your data frames that you will use as the labels for the circos plot. This will likely be the column with your exposure/outcome name in. Labels go on the outside of the plot.}

\item{section_column}{The column in your data frames that you will use to group/section your data/plot by.}

\item{order}{Do you want MR Viz to organise your columns alphabetically. Default is TRUE}

\item{order_column}{If order = FALSE what column do you want to order your sections by}

\item{estimate_column}{The column in your data frames with the estimates in.}

\item{pvalue_column}{The column in your data frames with the p-values in.}

\item{pvalue_adjustment}{The threshold you want to set your p-value 'significance' threshold too. This can be in the format of a single value or a function e.g. 0.05/22. The p-value thrshold is only used for scatter plots.}

\item{lower_ci}{The column in your data frames with the lower confidence intervals in.}

\item{upper_ci}{The column in your data frames with the upper confidence intervals in.}

\item{lines_column}{The column in your data frames that you want to plot as lines.}

\item{lines_type}{The type of line plot you want. "l" = straight lines; "o" = straight lines with points; "s" = boxed lines; "h" = vertical lines. Default is "o".}

\item{bar_column}{The column in your data frames that you want to plot as bars.}

\item{histogram_column}{The column in your data frames that you want to plot as histograms.}

\item{histogram_binsize}{The binsize of the histogram. Default is 0.01.}

\item{histogram_densityplot}{Do you want your histogram to be a density plot or not. Default is FALSE.}

\item{legend}{Do you want a legend = TRUE or FALSE. FALSE by default}

\item{track1_label}{What do you want the label for the first track to be e.g. "Body Mass Index"}

\item{track2_label}{What do you want the label for the first track to be e.g. "Corondary Heart Disease"}

\item{track3_label}{What do you want the label for the first track to be e.g. "Breast Cancer"}

\item{pvalue_label}{What do you want the label for the p-value to read e.g. "p-value <= 0.05"}

\item{circle_size}{The size of the circos plot. Smaller numbers make larger circos plots. Default is 25. You will need to adjust this number a few times to get the perfect size for your specific circos plot requirements. If you have long labels then try â‰¥ 25. If your labels are short try 1-10.}

\item{track1_height}{Size of the track as a percent of the whole circle. Default is 20 percent (0.20)}

\item{track2_height}{Size of the track as a percent of the whole circle. Default is 20 percent (0.20)}

\item{track3_height}{Size of the track as a percent of the whole circle. Default is 20 percent (0.20). It is sometimes worth increasing the size of track 3 to 30 percent}
