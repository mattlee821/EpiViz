# [`EpiViz`](https://mattlee.shinyapps.io/EpiViz/): application

The [`EpiViz`](https://mattlee.shinyapps.io/EpiViz/) application enables
users to create efficient Circos plots for a range of data common to
epidemiology. <br>

The functionality of the web application is limited to:

  - Point estimate and confidence interval
  - P-value signified by solid colour
  - P-value threshold selection
  - Legend - automatically populated by group
  - Two colour themes

For additional features use the [`R`
package](https://github.com/mattlee821/EpiViz/tree/master/R_package)
