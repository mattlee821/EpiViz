<p align="justify">You've made a plot but what next?</p>
</div>

<ul>

<li>Saving your plot</li>
<p align ="justify">By default the Circos plot is output as a <code>pdf</code> file. To save your Circos plot either <kbd>Right click</kbd> the displayed plot and select <kbd>Save as...</kbd> or select the <kbd>download</kbd> button towards the top of the displayed plot. Once saved you can use an image viewer such as Preview on Mac OS and Export the <code>pdf</code> as a <code>png</code>, <code>jpg</code> or other file type.</p>

<li>Advanced plots</li>
<p align ="justify">The <a href="https://github.com/mattlee821/EpiCircos"<code>R</code> package</a> offers more functionality than the web app. This includes use of line and box in addition to the scatter points used in the web app.</p>
