<h3> Example data</h3>
<p align="justify"> 
To demonstrate the use of <strong>EpiViz</strong> we performed a Mendelian randomization analysis of body mass index with 123 metabolites. We performed three analyses using genetic instruments for body mass index measured in Europeans: sex combined, males, females. Full details of the analysis are <a href="">available</a> and we provide the results from each analysis here as example data to use with the app.
