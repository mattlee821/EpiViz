<p align="justify"><strong>MR Viz</strong> is a visualisation tool that produces Circos plots. The tool was designed with large Mendelian randomization (MR) studies in mind but can be used with any data that has effect estimates and confidence intervals. </p>

<p align="justify">Example Circos plots are shown on the <i>MR Viz</i> tab. Example data can be downloaded from this page and can be used with the app. Follow the instructions on the <i>How to</i> tab in order to prepare your data and create your plots efficiently. Upload your data and create your plot on the <i>Analysis</i> tab.</p>

<p align="justify">Circos plots are based around tracks and your data should be formatted on the basis of how many tracks you want. If you want one track you need one data frame. If you want two tracks you need two data frames with the same labels and corresponding groups. If you want three tracks you need three data frame with the same labels and corresponding groups. You can not plot more than three tracks. For more customisation use the <a href="https://github.com/mattlee821/EpiCircos"<code>R</code> package</a>.</p>
