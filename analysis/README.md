# Analysis

We performed a two-sample summary level univariable Mendelian
randomization analysis of adiposity measures with 123 circulating
metabolites.

## Data

### Adiposity

We used two measures of adiposity: body mass index (BMI) and waist hip
ratio (WHR). Summary statistics were available from [Pulit et al.,
(2020)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6298238/).
Sex-combined and sex-specific summary statistics were used for all
measures.

### Metabolites

Summary statistics for 123 nuclear magnetic resonance derived
metabolites were obtained from [Kettunen et al., (2016)](). Only
sex-combined data were available.
